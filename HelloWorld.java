/*
 * Every program in Java is written as a class. 
 * Java is an object-oriented language and weâ€™ll learn more about classes and objects later. 
 * Inside the class, there can be a main method that starts the program. 
 * When you ask the Java run-time to run a class, it will always start execution in the main method. 
 * 
 * In Java every open curly brace { must have a matched close curly brace }. 
 * These are used to start and end class definitions and method definitions.
