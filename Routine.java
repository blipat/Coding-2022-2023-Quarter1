/* CODING 1 & 2 - PROBLEM SET 2.2
In this Problem Set, you will write a class that represents how you spend your time. The class should have at least four double instance variables, such as
school
sleep
friends
hobbies
gym
commuting

These variables will track the number of hours you spend doing each of these activities in a single day. The class should have mutators/“set” methods and accessors/“get” methods for each instance variable.

It should also have a method called printTotal that should print the total number of hours per week you spend doing each of these activities. Note you will have to calculate the weekly hours by using the daily hours stored in the instance variables. 

Here is an example of the output of printTotal if sleep = 8, school = 8, friends = 2.5, and hobbies = 2.
How You Spend Your Week
At School: 56.0
Sleeping: 56.0
With Friends: 17.5
Doing fun stuff: 14.0
